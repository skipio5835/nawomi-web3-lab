# Security Policy

## Scope

The `main` branch is maintained for Arc and Base testnet experimentation. The
contracts and interfaces are not approved for production custody or mainnet funds.

## Reporting

Report suspected vulnerabilities through this repository's private vulnerability
reporting form in the GitHub Security tab. Do not include private keys, seed phrases,
API credentials, Kit Keys, or live-wallet secrets in an issue or pull request.

## Local Safety

- Keep secrets in an ignored local `.env` file.
- Review the selected network, contract, function, recipient, value, and allowance
  in the wallet before every signature.
- Treat generated browser bundles as build output; review their TypeScript source.
- Run `npm audit --audit-level=low`, `npm run test-dependency-security`,
  `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test-arc-radar`, and `npm run security:contracts`
  before release. See `circle/arc/SECURITY.md` for the scoped dependency subsets
  and their maintenance requirements.
- Compare deployed runtime bytecode with the compiled release artifact before
  recording a deployment as verified.

Public testnet addresses and transaction receipts are not secrets, but they link
repository activity to an on-chain identity. Publish them only for reproducibility.

## Before Pushing

Run `npm run hooks:install` once per clone, including after `npm ci --ignore-scripts`.
This installs only a repository-local launcher for `.githooks/pre-push`. It does not
change global Git settings, remotes, or credentials, and refuses to overwrite a
custom hook or an existing `core.hooksPath` configuration.

Every non-deletion push runs `npm run check:push`: installed dependency validation,
an audit blocking low-or-higher advisories, dependency and hook regression tests,
TypeScript checks, ARCROW/server tests, and contract compilation/tests/lints.
Node.js/npm and Foundry must be available in the Git client's PATH. Missing tools,
an unreachable audit registry, or a failed check stop the push.

The hook accepts only a clean worktree and updates pointing to the checked-out
commit (including tags of that commit), then rechecks HEAD and files after testing.
Commit pending changes before pushing; for multiple branches, check out and push
each branch separately. Run `npm run check:push` manually during development.
These checks do not sign wallet transactions, deploy contracts, or load `.env`.

Local hooks are a convenience, not an unbypassable security boundary. Git clients
must execute hooks, and another clone needs its own installation. Keep GitHub
Security CI and CodeQL enabled; this gate cannot predict future advisories.
See the [Git pre-push documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_pre_push).
