# Arc Local Workflow

Run this before a local validation pass:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Nexus\Documents\Circle
npm.cmd run cycle:prepare
npm.cmd run start-deployer
```

Keep the server window open, then follow the printed checklist.

For flows that can safely run as one page sequence, print combo links:

```powershell
npm.cmd run cycle:combo
```

Open one combo at a time:

```powershell
npm.cmd run cycle:combo -- --open reward
npm.cmd run cycle:combo -- --open coupon
npm.cmd run cycle:combo -- --open referral
npm.cmd run cycle:combo -- --open cashback
npm.cmd run cycle:combo -- --open auction
npm.cmd run cycle:combo -- --open rental
npm.cmd run cycle:combo -- --open warranty
npm.cmd run cycle:combo -- --open support
npm.cmd run cycle:combo -- --open access
```

Each combo opens the page with `autorun=1` and combines same-page actions.
Approve wallet requests only after reviewing them. Do not open multiple combo tabs
at once, because overlapping prompts can create duplicate transactions.

If port `4173` is already serving a page without `/api/arcinvoice`, run the app on
another port and print the checklist with the same port:

```powershell
$env:PORT="4174"; npm.cmd run cycle:today
$env:PORT="4174"; npm.cmd run start-deployer
```

The checklist changes slightly by date. It rotates small amounts, swap direction, bridge destination, raw CCTP destination, issued token, Dev Wallet amount, memo receipt amount, batch payout rows, ArcInvoice amount, token allowance amount, delegated transfer amount, ArcEscrow amount, escrow settlement outcome, ArcEscrow dispute evidence/resolution, ArcSubscription price/cadence, ArcMembership pass price/renewal days, ArcSavingsVault goal/deposit/withdraw amounts, ArcPoll vote choices/reasons, ArcAirdrop campaign allocations, ArcBounty rewards/submissions, ArcMilestone funding/submissions, ArcExpense contribution/withdraw amounts, ArcEvent ticket pricing/supply, ArcMarketplace order pricing/fulfillment, ArcService booking pricing/completion, ArcDonation campaign goals/messages, ArcPreorder pricing/fulfillment, ArcPayroll claim receipts, ArcRefundableDeposit outcomes, ArcInstallment staged payments, ArcVesting unlock claims, ArcGiftCard voucher redemptions, ArcReward claim receipts, ArcCoupon claim receipts, ArcReferral claim receipts, ArcCashback claim receipts, ArcAuction bid receipts, ArcRental deposit returns, zero-value ArcWarranty claim receipts, zero-value ArcSupport ticket receipts, and zero-value ArcAccess approval receipts.
